# StepOne-Recommedation-System-
This is the starter code of the recommender system.
In this code the Movie, Rating, Rater are the POJO(Plain old java object) classes. The main work is done on the the FirstRatings file. In this part we only add the functionality 
to read the files in the FirstRating class. The first file contained the data of the movies and the movies rating the second file contained the data of the rater and the movies he had rated.
The different methods inside the FirstRating file do all this task of reading and storing the data of these files in the different dataStructure.
